## üåü Features

- **Unified Setup**: One script (`ainish-setup.sh`) to configure all your AI coding assistants.
- **Initial File Sync**: Automatically runs `copy.sh` to distribute key files (`critical.mdc`, `PRD.mdc`, `prompt.md`) to appropriate tool directories, with confirmation prompts.
- **Multiple AI Tool Support**: 
  - `ainish-aider`: Configuration for the Aider AI pair programming assistant.
  - `ainish-cursor`: Cursor IDE specific configurations and ignore files.
  - `ainish-copilot`: GitHub Copilot and related tool configurations.
- **Automatic Configuration**: Includes Gitignore rules and tool-specific ignore files.
- **Wrapper Functions**: Sets up convenient shell commands (`ainish-cursor`, `ainish-aider`, `ainish-copilot`, `ainish-coder`) for easy tool usage.

## üöÄ Installation & Updating

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/nbiish/ainish-coder
cd ainish-coder

# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x ainish-setup.sh copy.sh

# Run the setup script
# This performs the full setup/update process:
# 1. Runs copy.sh to sync files (critical.mdc, PRD.mdc, prompt.md)
# 2. Sets up ~/.ainish-coder with symlinks
# 3. Installs/Updates wrapper functions in .zshrc
./ainish-setup.sh
```

After installation or update, you may need to run `source ~/.zshrc` (or your shell's equivalent) to activate the latest wrapper functions.

To update later, simply pull the latest changes into the repository directory and re-run `./ainish-setup.sh`.

## üì¶ Components

### ainish-aider
- `.aider.conf.yml`: Core configuration file
- `.aider-instructions.md`: Custom instructions for the Aider assistant (from `prompt.md`)
- `.aiderignore`: File patterns to exclude from Aider
- `.env.example`: Environment variable template
- `critical.mdc`: License citation file (from root `critical.mdc`)
- `PRD.mdc`: Project requirements doc (from root `PRD.mdc`)

### ainish-cursor
- `.cursor/`: Cursor IDE configuration directory
- `.cursor/rules/gikendaasowin.md`: Cognitive Agent instructions (from `prompt.md`, handled by `deploy_cursor_configs`)
- `.cursor/rules/critical.mdc`: License citation file (from root `critical.mdc`)
- `.cursor/rules/PRD.mdc`: Project requirements doc (from root `PRD.mdc`)
- `.cursorignore`: Rules for files to exclude from Cursor AI
- `.cursorindexingignore`: Rules for files to exclude from indexing

### ainish-copilot
- `.copilotignore`: Rules for files to exclude from GitHub Copilot
- `.rooignore`: Rules for the Roo extension
- `.github/`: GitHub specific configurations
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Custom instructions (from `prompt.md`)
- `.github/critical.mdc`: License citation file (from root `critical.mdc`)
- `.github/PRD.mdc`: Project requirements doc (from root `PRD.mdc`)

## üîß How It Works

The `ainish-setup.sh` script:
1. Executes `./copy.sh` to synchronize `critical.mdc`, `PRD.mdc`, and `prompt.md` from the root to their respective tool directories, asking for user confirmation first.
2. Creates a `~/.ainish-coder` directory.
3. Creates symbolic links from `~/.ainish-coder` to the tool configuration directories (`ainish-aider`, `ainish-cursor`, `ainish-copilot`) in the repository, ensuring changes in the repo are reflected immediately.
4. Adds convenient wrapper functions (`ainish-cursor`, `ainish-aider`, etc.) to your shell configuration (`.zshrc`).
5. Cleans up potentially conflicting older configuration files.
6. Verifies tool paths.

The wrapper functions (`ainish-cursor`, `ainish-aider`, `ainish-copilot`, `ainish-coder`) ensure that the necessary configurations are deployed to the current working directory when you invoke the tool via the wrapper.

Re-running `./ainish-setup.sh` refreshes the entire setup, including re-running `copy.sh` and updating the wrappers.
