## üåü Features

- **Unified Setup**: One script to configure all your AI coding assistants
- **Multiple AI Tool Support**: 
  - `ainish-aider`: Configuration for the Aider AI pair programming assistant
  - `ainish-cursor`: Cursor IDE specific configurations and ignore files
  - `ainish-copilot`: GitHub Copilot and related tool configurations
- **Automatic Configuration**: Gitignore rules and tool-specific ignore files included with each component

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nbiish/ainish-coder
cd ainish-coder

# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x ainish-setup.sh

# Run the setup script
./ainish-setup.sh
```

After installation, you can periodically run `ainish-update` to ensure all configurations, including critical.mdc files, are kept in sync across all ainish-* directories.

## üì¶ Components

### ainish-aider
- `.aider.conf.yml`: Core configuration file
- `.aider-instructions.md`: Custom instructions for the Aider assistant
- `.aiderignore`: File patterns to exclude from Aider
- `.env.example`: Environment variable template
- `critical.mdc`: License citation file for Aider

### ainish-cursor
- `.cursor/`: Cursor IDE configuration directory
- `.cursorignore`: Rules for files to exclude from Cursor AI
- `.cursorindexingignore`: Rules for files to exclude from indexing

### ainish-copilot
- `.copilotignore`: Rules for files to exclude from GitHub Copilot
- `.rooignore`: Rules for the Roo extension
- `.github/`: GitHub specific configurations

## üîß How It Works

The `ainish-setup.sh` script:
1. Creates a `~/.ainish-coder` directory to store all configurations
2. Creates symbolic links to the original repo directories
3. Updates or creates `.gitignore` with AI-specific entries
4. Adds wrapper functions to your shell configuration
5. Verifies all components are properly installed
6. Ensures critical.mdc is copied to all ainish-* directories during updates

The script also provides the `ainish-update` command which:
- Updates critical.mdc in all ainish-* directories automatically
- Ensures license compliance and configuration consistency across all components
- Re-runs the setup script to refresh all configurations
