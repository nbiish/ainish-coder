## üåü Features

- **Unified Setup**: One script (`ainish-setup.sh`) to configure all your AI coding assistants.
- **Automatic File Distribution**: The setup script automatically distributes key files (`critical.mdc`, `MEMORY-BANK.mdc`, `prompt.md`) to appropriate tool directories.
- **Multiple AI Tool Support**: 
  - `ainish-aider`: Configuration for the Aider AI pair programming assistant.
  - `ainish-cursor`: Cursor IDE specific configurations and ignore files.
  - `ainish-copilot`: GitHub Copilot and related tool configurations.
- **Automatic Configuration**: Includes Gitignore rules and tool-specific ignore files.
- **Wrapper Functions**: Sets up convenient shell commands (`ainish-cursor`, `ainish-aider`, `ainish-copilot`, `ainish-coder`) for easy tool usage.

## üöÄ Installation & Updating

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/nbiish/ainish-coder
cd ainish-coder

# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x ainish-setup.sh

# Run the setup script
# This performs the full setup/update process:
# 1. Distributes files (critical.mdc, MEMORY-BANK.mdc, prompt.md) to tool directories
# 2. Sets up ~/.ainish-coder with symlinks
# 3. Installs/Updates wrapper functions in .zshrc
./ainish-setup.sh
```

After installation or update, you may need to run `source ~/.zshrc` (or your shell's equivalent) to activate the latest wrapper functions.

To update later, simply pull the latest changes into the repository directory and re-run `./ainish-setup.sh`.

## üì¶ Components

### ainish-aider
- `.gitignore`: Standard Git ignore rules
- `aider-cli-commands.sh`: CLI commands for Aider
- `critical.mdc`: License citation file (from root `critical.mdc`)
- `MEMORY-BANK.mdc`: Project requirements doc (from root `MEMORY-BANK.mdc`)
- `docs-use.mdc`: Documentation usage guidelines (from root `docs-use.mdc`)

### ainish-cursor
- `.cursor/`: Cursor IDE configuration directory
- `.cursor/rules/gikendaasowin.md`: Cognitive Agent instructions (from `prompt.md`)
- `.cursor/rules/critical.mdc`: License citation file (from root `critical.mdc`)
- `.cursor/rules/MEMORY-BANK.mdc`: Project requirements doc (from root `MEMORY-BANK.mdc`)
- `.cursor/rules/docs-use.mdc`: Documentation usage guidelines (from root `docs-use.mdc`)

### ainish-copilot
- `.github/`: GitHub specific configurations
- `.github/critical.mdc`: License citation file (from root `critical.mdc`)
- `.github/MEMORY-BANK.mdc`: Project requirements doc (from root `MEMORY-BANK.mdc`)
- `.github/docs-use.mdc`: Documentation usage guidelines (from root `docs-use.mdc`)

## üîß How It Works

The `ainish-setup.sh` script:
1. Automatically distributes `critical.mdc`, `MEMORY-BANK.mdc`, `prompt.md`, and `docs-use.mdc` from the root to their respective tool directories.
2. Creates a `~/.ainish-coder` directory.
3. Creates symbolic links from `~/.ainish-coder` to the tool configuration directories (`ainish-aider`, `ainish-cursor`, `ainish-copilot`) in the repository, ensuring changes in the repo are reflected immediately.
4. Adds convenient wrapper functions (`ainish-cursor`, `ainish-aider`, etc.) to your shell configuration (`.zshrc`).
5. Cleans up potentially conflicting older configuration files.
6. Verifies tool paths.

The wrapper functions (`ainish-cursor`, `ainish-aider`, `ainish-copilot`, `ainish-coder`) ensure that the necessary configurations are deployed to the current working directory when you invoke the tool via the wrapper.

Re-running `./ainish-setup.sh` refreshes the entire setup, including re-distributing files and updating the wrappers.
