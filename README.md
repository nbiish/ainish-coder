## ᐴ ONAAKONIGE ᔔ [Configuration] ◈──◆──◇──◆──◈

### Structured VSCode Distribution

The project now features a structured distribution system for VSCode/Copilot configurations that separates key instruction files for better organization and accessibility:

#### **Separate Instruction Files:**
- **`modern-prompting.instructions.md`**: Advanced cognitive framework for LLM interactions, available as a standalone file for easy reference and integration
- **`anishinaabe-cyberpunk-style.instructions.md`**: Cultural styling guide combining Anishinaabe elements with cyberpunk aesthetics, available as a separate file for design consistency

#### **Consolidated Instructions:**
- **`copilot-instructions.md`**: Combines all other development guidelines, security protocols, and best practices into a single, professionally organized reference

This structured approach provides GitHub Copilot with:

- **Security & Cybersecurity Framework** (Highest Priority) - Available in consolidated file
- **Modern Prompting & Context Engineering** (Core Methodology) - Available as separate file
- **Code Judge & Reasoning Framework** (Cognitive Development) - Available in consolidated file
- **Code Structure & Architecture** (Development Standards) - Available in consolidated file
- **Package Management Rules** (Technology-Specific) - Available in consolidated file
- **Documentation & Context Rules** (Project Alignment) - Available in consolidated file
- **Time & Information Gathering** (Current Data Protocol) - Available in consolidated file
- **Critical Operations** (Essential Procedures) - Available in consolidated file
- **Anishinaabe-Cyberpunk Styling** (Cultural Integration) - Available as separate file

### Flexible File Formats

The project now supports multiple file format options to meet different needs:

- **`.mdc` Format** (Default): Custom markdown format with enhanced metadata and structure
- **`.md` Format** (`--markdown` flag): Standard markdown format for better compatibility with:
  - Standard markdown editors and tools
  - GitHub markdown rendering
  - Universal markdown processors
  - Better integration with existing workflows

### Product Requirements Documentation

The project includes a comprehensive **Product Requirements Document (PRD.md)** that serves as the foundation for all development decisions. The PRD includes:

- **Objective and Purpose**: Clear definition of project goals and cultural integration
- **Scope and Features**: Detailed in-scope and out-of-scope feature definitions
- **User Experience Flow**: Complete user journey from installation to usage
- **QAMMML Structure**: Quanta-Atoms-Molecules-Matter-Matter-Phase-Lifeform architecture
- **Functional Requirements**: Core features and security implementations
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, reliability, and cultural sensitivity standards
- **Success Metrics**: Key performance indicators and acceptance criteria
- **Knowledge Base**: Comprehensive documentation and cultural context

The PRD embodies Indigenous intellectual property principles while maintaining technical excellence and serves as a living document for project development.

### Anishinaabe-Cyberpunk Styling

This project uses a unique **Anishinaabe-Cyberpunk** styling approach that combines elements from Anishinaabe culture with cyberpunk aesthetics. This is documented in `anishinaabe-cyberpunk-style.mdc`, which provides detailed guidelines on:

- Cultural context for symbol usage
- Markdown styling elements (headers, dividers, banners)
- Shell script styling patterns
- Standard Anishinaabe terms with translations
- Cyberpunk symbol reference guide

This styling creates a distinctive visual identity that:
- Honors Anishinaabe language and cultural elements
- Incorporates modern cyberpunk aesthetics for technical documentation
- Creates a visually compelling and cohesive project appearance

The style guide is automatically distributed to all tool directories, ensuring consistent formatting across documentation.

For examples of this styling, see the **Standard Anishinaabe Terms** section in `anishinaabe-cyberpunk-style.mdc`.

## ᐴ GIGWEJIWEWIN ᔔ [Troubleshooting] ◈──◆──◇──◆──◈

### **Common Installation Issues**

#### **Git Not Found:**
```bash
git: command not found
```
**Solution:** Install Git using the instructions in the Prerequisites section above.

#### **Permission Denied:**
```bash
Permission denied (publickey)
```
**Solution:** This is normal for public repositories. The clone should still work.

#### **Script Not Executable (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
bash: ./ainish-setup.sh: Permission denied
```
**Solution:** Run `chmod +x ainish-setup.sh` to make the script executable.

#### **Script Won't Run (Windows):**
```cmd
'ainish-setup.sh' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```
**Solution:** Use PowerShell instead of Command Prompt, or run `bash ainish-setup.sh` if you have Git Bash installed.

### **Common Usage Issues**

**Q: The wrapper functions aren't working after installation.**  
A: Try reloading your shell configuration:
- **macOS/Linux:** `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc`
- **Windows PowerShell:** `. $PROFILE`
- **Windows Command Prompt:** Restart your command prompt

**Q: I'm using a shell other than zsh, how do I set up the wrapper functions?**  
A: The script automatically detects your shell and configures accordingly. If you have issues, manually copy the wrapper functions from `~/.zshrc` to your shell's configuration file.

**Q: Path validation fails during setup.**  
A: Edit the `ainish-setup.sh` file to update the `CURSOR_PATH` variable to match your system's Cursor installation path.

**Q: Files aren't being distributed to the tool directories.**  
A: Make sure you have the correct file structure in your repository. All root files (`critical.mdc`, etc.) should be in the main repository directory.

**Q: My changes to configuration files aren't taking effect.**  
A: The script uses symlinks to ensure changes to repository files are immediately available. If a file was modified directly in `~/.ainish-coder`, make sure to update the original file in the repository.

### **Cross-Platform Considerations**

#### **Windows:**
- **PowerShell (Recommended):** Full support with automatic shell detection
- **Command Prompt:** Basic support, some features may be limited
- **WSL:** Full Linux compatibility, recommended for advanced users
- **Git Bash:** Full bash compatibility, good alternative to PowerShell

#### **Linux:**
- **Bash:** Full support, default on most distributions
- **Zsh:** Full support, popular alternative shell
- **Fish:** Full support, modern shell with enhanced features
- **Other shells:** May require manual configuration

#### **macOS:**
- **Zsh:** Full support, default shell since macOS Catalina
- **Bash:** Full support, available as alternative
- **Homebrew:** Recommended for easy package management

### **Platform-Specific Issues**

#### **Windows Issues:**
- **PowerShell Execution Policy:** If you get execution policy errors, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- **Line Endings:** If you see strange characters, ensure Git is configured with `git config --global core.autocrlf true`

#### **Linux Issues:**
- **Shell Detection:** If the script doesn't detect your shell correctly, manually specify it in the setup script
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have write permissions to your home directory

#### **macOS Issues:**
- **Gatekeeper:** If you get security warnings, right-click the script and select "Open"
- **Shell Version:** Ensure you're using a modern version of zsh or bash
