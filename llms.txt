# SOTA Agent-Tree Trunk (llms.txt)
# Protocol: INIT | BRANCH | SYNC | MERGE
# Ref: OSA.md (Patterns) | TODO.md (Checklist) | TOON (Memory)

[SETUP]
1. GATHER: Run `ainish-coder --osa` to pull detailed framework files.
2. MEMORY: Use TOON for shared state in OSAVARS.toon.
3. INIT: Start Claude Code Ralph Loop (`/ralph-loop`) on Trunk.
4. TRACK: Use TODO.md for tasks and OSAVARS.toon for shared state.
5. DOCS: Reference `OSA.md` for patterns and orchestration directives.

[BOOTSTRAP]
MEMORY: TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)
ORCHESTRATOR: Claude Code (Ralph Loop)
SUB-AGENTS: Gemini (CLI), Qwen (CLI), Opencode (CLI)

[PROTOCOL]
INIT: Load llms.txt + OSA.md. Sync latest context from OSAVARS.toon.
TRUNK: Ralph (Claude) designs the Strategic Plan in TODO.md.
BRANCH: Ralph spawns sub-agent branches using patterns in OSA.md.
SYNC: Agents update OSAVARS.toon [VARS] and logs.
MERGE: Ralph verifies branch results, updates TODO.md, and persists state to OSAVARS.toon.

[STATE]
VERSION: 4.1.0-TOON-SOTA
VARS_STORE: OSAVARS.toon
TODO_TRACKER: TODO.md
MEMORY_ENGINE: TOON

[DIRECTIVES]
- Minimal verbiage; use symbols/shorthand.
- Every branch updates TODO.md status and OSAVARS.toon state.
- Ralph Loop MUST review every sub-agent output for security and logic.
- Use TOON tables for every successful "Promise" completed.
