# SOTA Agent-Tree Trunk (llms.txt)
# Protocol: INIT | BRANCH | SYNC | MERGE
# Ref: OSA.md (Patterns) | CLAUDE_CODE_RALPH_LOOP.md (Orchestrator) | TODO.md (Checklist) | TOON (Memory)

[SETUP]
1. INIT: Start Claude Code Ralph Loop (`/ralph-loop`) on Trunk.
2. TRACK: Use TODO.md for tasks and OSAVARS.toon for shared state.
3. DOCS: Reference `OSA.md` for patterns and orchestration directives.

[BOOTSTRAP]
MEMORY: TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) - Ref: TOON.md
ORCHESTRATOR: Claude Code (Ralph Loop)
SUB-AGENTS: Gemini (CLI), Qwen (CLI), Opencode (CLI)

[PROTOCOL]
INIT: Load llms.txt + OSA.md. Sync context from OSAVARS.toon (Memory).
TRUNK: Ralph (Claude) acts as "Supervisor", managing the Loop.
KANBAN: Atomic tasks in TODO.md (The Queue) -> Pick -> Implement -> Verify -> Done.
BRANCH: Spawn sub-agents (Gemini/Qwen/Opencode) for heavy lifting or reviews.
SYNC: Update OSAVARS.toon (Short-term Memory) with vars and logs.
RESET: Clear context between phases to prevent hallucination (Context Hygiene).

[STATE]
VERSION: 5.0.0-RALPH-KANBAN
VARS_STORE: OSAVARS.toon (Short-term Memory)
TODO_TRACKER: TODO.md (The Queue)
MEMORY_ENGINE: TOON (Protocol)
LONG_TERM: OSA.md (Patterns & Standards)

[DIRECTIVES]
- **Atomic Stories**: Break tasks into small, testable units in TODO.md.
- **Context Hygiene**: Reset context after major phases.
- **3-Layer Memory**: Use TODO.md (Queue), OSAVARS.toon (Loop Context), OSA.md (Standards).
- Every branch updates TODO.md status and OSAVARS.toon state.
- Ralph Loop MUST review every sub-agent output for security and logic.
