# SOTA Agent-Tree Trunk (llms.txt)
# Protocol: INIT | BRANCH | SYNC | MERGE
# Ref: OSA.md (Patterns) | TODO.md (Checklist)

[PROTOCOL]
INIT: Start Ralph Loop (/ralph-loop) on Trunk. Load llms.txt + OSA.md. Create TODO.md + OSAVARS.md if null.
TRUNK: Ralph acts as Orchestrator. Spawns BRANCHES via CLI.
BRANCH: Spawn sub-agents per OSA.md pattern. Pass context via OSAVARS.md [VARS].
RALPH: High-intensity autonomous loop (Claude-specific) for deep work.
SYNC: Updates in OSAVARS.md or TODO.md MUST be atomic.
MERGE: Branches return results to Trunk; Ralph verifies and iterates if necessary.

[STATE]
# Variable Store (See OSAVARS.md for dynamic values)
VERSION: 3.0.0-RALPH-FIRST
VARS_STORE: OSAVARS.md
TODO_TRACKER: TODO.md


[DIRECTIVES]
- Minimal verbiage; use symbols/shorthand.
- Every branch updates TODO.md status.
- Security-first (PQC/Zero-Trust) in all code.
- RALPH-TRUNK: Prioritize starting all complex tasks with `/ralph-loop`.
- LOOP-BACK: If sub-agent output is partial, Trunk Ralph MUST iterate to completion.
