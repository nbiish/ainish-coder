# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT: AINISH-CODER LLM TOOLING

## 1. OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Purpose

AI-assisted development environment providing structured tooling for LLM-driven code generation, documentation, and project management with Anishinaabe cyberpunk aesthetic integration.

### 1.2 Core Features

- **Structured MDC Documentation System**: YAML-frontmatter files for precise LLM instruction delivery
- **Multi-LLM Tooling Support**: Aider, Copilot, Cursor integration with unified workflow
- **Context-Aware AI Assistance**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for real-time documentation access
- **Cultural Design Integration**: Anishinaabe cyberpunk aesthetic with modern UX standards

## 2. FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS

### 2.1 Design Standards

- Adherence to accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Responsive design for terminal and web interfaces
- Anishinaabe cyberpunk visual language integration
- Consistent typography and color schemes across tools

### 2.2 User Interface Components

- Command-line interfaces with rich output formatting
- File structure visualization for mdc/documentation hierarchy
- Real-time status indicators for AI tool operations
- Interactive setup and configuration wizards

## 3. BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Core Architecture

- **File Processing Engine**: MDC header parsing and validation
- **Context Management**: Dynamic rule application based on globs and alwaysApply flags
- **Integration Layer**: Unified API for Aider, Copilot, and Cursor tools
- **Documentation Pipeline**: MCP tool integration for real-time library documentation

### 3.2 API Behaviors

```yaml
MDC_Parser:
  input: file_path, content
  output: parsed_metadata, validation_status
  error_handling: conservative_interpretation, backward_compatibility

Context_Manager:
  input: current_task, file_patterns
  output: applicable_rules, priority_order
  behavior: respect_alwaysApply, honor_globs

Integration_Controller:
  input: tool_type, command, context
  output: unified_response, status_metrics
  supported_tools: [aider, copilot, cursor]
```

## 4. DATA MODEL

### 4.1 MDC Header Schema

```yaml
required_fields:
  - description: string (purpose/context hint)
optional_fields:
  - globs: string (comma-separated file patterns)
  - alwaysApply: boolean (unconditional application flag)
  - contextType: enum [rule, documentation, configuration]
```

### 4.2 Configuration Entities

- **Tool Profiles**: Per-LLM configuration and capabilities
- **Project Context**: Repository-specific settings and preferences
- **Rule Hierarchy**: Priority ordering for conflicting directives

## 5. ENDPOINT BEHAVIORS

### 5.1 File Processing

- **Parse MDC Headers**: Extract and validate YAML frontmatter
- **Apply Context Rules**: Determine applicable processing directives
- **Generate Responses**: Format output according to specified constraints

### 5.2 Tool Integration

- **Unified Command Interface**: Single entry point for multi-tool operations
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time feedback on AI tool operations
- **Error Recovery**: Fallback mechanisms for tool failures

## 6. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### 6.1 File Access Controls

- Respect gitignore patterns for sensitive files
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Sanitize user inputs in MDC headers

### 6.2 AI Tool Security

- Sandbox execution environments for code generation
- Input validation for LLM prompts
- Audit logging for AI-generated changes

## 7. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

### 7.1 Response Times

- MDC header parsing: <100ms per file
- Context rule application: <200ms for full repository scan
- AI tool integration: <5s for simple operations

### 7.2 Scalability

- Support repositories with 10,000+ files
- Concurrent AI tool operations
- Efficient caching for repeated operations

## 8. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### 8.1 Core Functionality

✓ MDC headers parse correctly with YAML validation
✓ glob patterns match intended file sets
✓ alwaysApply flag enforces unconditional rule application
✓ Multiple LLM tools integrate seamlessly
✓ MCP documentation access works in real-time

### 8.2 User Experience

✓ Setup script completes successfully on macOS/Linux
✓ Documentation is discoverable and actionable
✓ Error messages provide clear guidance
✓ Cultural design elements enhance rather than obstruct functionality

### 8.3 Technical Requirements

✓ All tools respect MDC header directives
✓ No conflicts between different AI assistants
✓ Fallback mechanisms handle tool failures gracefully
✓ Security protocols prevent unauthorized access

## 9. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### 9.1 Development Workflow

1. Stakeholder collaboration for feature prioritization
2. Detailed feature prompts with comprehensive requirements
3. LLM-assisted PRD generation and refinement
4. Iterative development with continuous validation

### 9.2 Quality Assurance

- Automated testing for MDC header processing
- Integration testing across all supported LLM tools
- User acceptance testing with diverse project types
- Performance benchmarking against established metrics
