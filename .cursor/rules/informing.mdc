# Concise Comments Are Good Comments

All code should be accompanied by a ultra concise comment description that contextualizes the function, algorithm, and purpose.

## Example Usage

```python
# [[function]] -> [[purpose]]
```

# #!/usr/bin/env [[language]]

The "right" shebang...
    - (e.g., #!/usr/bin/env [[language]]) ensures scripts are executed correctly.
