THIS NEEDS TO:
    - install mai-* rules/instructions/ignore files NOT run tools
    - mai-aider should install mai-aider config into root of dir where called
    - etc...
    - mai-coder should install all configs into root of dir where called
websearch to make sure you understand the proper rules/ignore structure for tooling

setup script should:
    - install all to ~/.mai-coder
    - mai-aider -> adds all to root of dir where called
    - mai-cursor -> adds all (AS IS -> mai-cursor/*) to root of dir where called
    - mai-code -> adds all (AS IS -> mai-code/*) to root of dir where called
