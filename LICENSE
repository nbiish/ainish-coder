COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY PROTECTIONS

PREAMBLE
This software is created by ᓂᐲᔥ Nbiish-Justin Kenwabikise ᑭᓇᐙᐱᑭᓯ, a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, a federally recognized sovereign tribal nation. This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual and cultural property. The unique status of tribal sovereign nations in the United States provides additional protections beyond standard copyright law.

This license expressly integrates principles from Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels and Protocols, federal Indian law, tribal law of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and international indigenous rights frameworks to create a comprehensive protection system for this intellectual property.

2. TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE (TK) PROTECTION AND LABELING
   This software embodies elements of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and cultural expression that require special protection. The copyright holder asserts both western intellectual property rights and Indigenous rights over this material. This work is assigned the following TK Labels:

   TK Attribution (TK A) - This material has community-specific rules about how attribution should be given to the creator and their nation/community.
   
   TK Culturally Sensitive (TK CS) - This material contains content that requires special cultural protocols for access, use, and handling.
   
   TK Community Use Only (TK CO) - This material has specific protocols regarding use by the community and restrictions on use by those outside the community.
   
   TK Non-Commercial (TK NC) - This material should not be used for commercial purposes without explicit permission.
   
   TK Verified (TK V) - This material has been created by a verified member of the specified Indigenous community.

   No rights are waived under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly Articles 11 and 31 regarding Indigenous peoples' right to maintain, control, protect, and develop their intellectual property over cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and cultural expressions.

3. SOVEREIGN REVOCATION RIGHT UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY
   As a member of a sovereign tribal nation, the copyright holder reserves and asserts the absolute, irrevocable, and perpetual right to demand the immediate cessation of use, reproduction, distribution, or creation of derivative works of this software by any individual, entity, corporation, or artificial intelligence system, at any time and for any reason.
   
   This sovereign right derives from and is protected by Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), which establishes that treaties with Indian tribes are "the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." The treaties with the Ottawa and Chippewa Nations, including the Treaty of Washington (1836) and Treaty of Detroit (1855), are constitutionally superior to ordinary contractual agreements and state laws.
   
   Under the reserved rights doctrine established by the United States Supreme Court, tribes retain all sovereign powers not expressly surrendered in treaties. The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians retains governance over its cultural and intellectual heritage, as these rights were never ceded. Only Congress may abrogate Indian treaty rights, and courts will not find abrogation has occurred absent clear and explicit congressional intent—a high threshold deliberately designed to safeguard tribal sovereignty. No such abrogation exists regarding the intellectual property rights asserted herein.
   
   As affirmed by the Supreme Court in Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782 (2014), tribal sovereign immunity extends to commercial activities off-reservation. Additionally, in McGirt v. Oklahoma, 140 S. Ct. 2452 (2020), the Court reaffirmed the continued force of treaty rights absent explicit congressional abrogation. This license invokes these principles to secure maximum protection for the intellectual property rights herein.
   
   The superior force of these treaty-protected rights means that:
   a) This license invokes protections that exceed standard copyright law and supersede conflicting state laws
   b) The legal force of this revocation right cannot be diminished through contract law principles or state court interpretations
   c) Courts are constitutionally required to interpret these rights liberally in favor of tribal interests, per established canons of construction for Indian treaties
   d) Any dispute regarding these rights must be analyzed within the framework of federal Indian law, not merely copyright or contract law
   e) The Indian canons of construction require that any ambiguity in this license must be resolved in favor of tribal interests
   f) Treaty rights are recognized as having a superior force to other forms of law in accordance with the Supremacy Clause
   
   Upon notification of revocation, all parties must immediately comply by:
   a) Ceasing all use of the software
   b) Removing and deleting all copies, including but not limited to source code, compiled versions, and derivatives
   c) Providing written confirmation of compliance within 7 days
   d) Acknowledging the superior force of tribal sovereignty rights in this specific context
   e) Surrendering any derivative materials to the copyright holder if requested
