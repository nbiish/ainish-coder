# CRITICAL: ```uv``` MUST be used for all Python tasks

- ```uv venv``` -> Creates ```.venv``` in the current directory
- ```uv pip install some-package``` -> Installs packages into the current directory's ```.venv```
- ```uv run needs-some-package.py``` -> Runs python files with the current directory's ```.venv``` dependencies
