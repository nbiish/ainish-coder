# When encountering an error, lack of context, or something you don't factually know

- Use the context7 mcp tool to gather verified package/library/framework/language/tool specific knowledge.
- Use the default/internal websearch tool to gather general knowledge.
- Use the mcp websearch tools like brave and tavily to gather more information with different context (if repeat nearly identical results come back you now it can be considered a fact and added to the knowledge base)
- Use the fetch tool to gather highly specific information into our knowledge base.
