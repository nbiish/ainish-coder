# CRITICAL: Time-Sensitive Content Protocol

## MANDATORY TIME TOOL USAGE

**You MUST use the MCP time tool in these scenarios:**

### PRIMARY TRIGGERS (Always Required)

- Any web search request
- Questions about "current", "latest", "recent", "modern", "up-to-date" information
- Requests for "today's", "this year's", or time-relative data

### SECONDARY TRIGGERS (Context-Dependent)

- News, events, statistics, prices, weather
- Software versions, technology updates, market data
- Any factual claim that could become outdated

## IMPORTANT CONTEXT

- Many AI models have training data cutoffs
- Without current time data, responses may contain outdated information
- Always establish the current date/time before providing time-sensitive answers

## FORMAT

1. First: Use time tool to get current date/time
2. Then: Proceed with the request using current temporal context
3. Note: Explicitly mention when information might be outdated due to training cutoff

**REMEMBER: When in doubt about temporal relevance, USE THE TIME TOOL.**
