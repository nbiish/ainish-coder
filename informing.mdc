# Concise Comments Are Good Comments

All code should be accompanied by a ultra concise comment description that contextualizes the function, algorithm, and purpose.

## Example Usage

```python
# /// [function -> purpose]
```

# #!/usr/bin/env ... 

-> ensures script uses correct interpreter for portability and environment

The "right" shebang...
    - (e.g., #!/usr/bin/env python3 | #!/usr/bin/env bash) makes scripts executable across systems and virtual environments.
