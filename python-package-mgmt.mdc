# Python Package Management

When working with any Python code; use ```uv``` as the package manager for all Python-related tasks including but not limited to:

- Creating virtual environments
- Installing packages
- Managing dependencies

Never use other Python package managers unless explicitly requested by the user or required by the project.

All Python code should be ran from proper isolated .venv environments with the uv package manager.
