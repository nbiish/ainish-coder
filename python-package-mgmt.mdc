# Python Package Management Rule
When working with Python projects, always use 'uv' as the package manager for all Python-related tasks including:
- Installing packages
- Creating virtual environments
- Managing dependencies
- Building projects
- Publishing packages

Never suggest or use pip, conda, poetry, or other Python package managers unless explicitly requested by the user.
