# Security Progress Log

Date (America/New_York): 2025-08-07 19:42

## Changes

- Strengthened `prompt.md` with additional guardrails: default-deny agency, secrets/PII hygiene, auditability, command execution safeguards, and supply-chain integrity.
- Added LLM Top 10-aligned checklist and security gates requiring explicit authorization for high-risk actions.
- Expanded cryptography policy (Argon2id, HKDF, AES-GCM-SIV options) and clarified compliance/data governance expectations.

## Impact

- Tighter controls reduce risk of prompt injection, output misuse, excessive agency, and secret leakage.
- Clearer execution policy and audit requirements improve operational security and traceability.

## Next

- Consider integrating CI checks for SBOM generation and signature verification.
