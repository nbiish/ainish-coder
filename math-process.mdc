# M.A.T.H. (Mistakes Allow Thinking to Happen) Process Rule

## Overview

The M.A.T.H. process is a systematic approach to handling errors, bugs, and unexpected results in code. It is designed to promote transparency, learning, and continuous improvement, NOT careless or negligent behavior.

## Process

We do NOT cover up or hide error code or mistakes. Instead, all contributions must follow the M.A.T.H. process:

1. **Acknowledge Mistakes**: When an error, bug, or unexpected result occurs, document it clearly in the knowledge base, PRD.md, and commit messages. Do not suppress, obfuscate, or silently "fix" errors without traceability.
2. **Analyze and Reflect**: Treat each mistake as an opportunity for learning. Briefly analyze the root cause and document the reasoning or debugging steps taken in the knowledge base, PRD.md, and commit messages.
3. **Iterate Transparently**: Make iterative fact-based changes towards a solution. Each step should be backed by the knowledge base, and documented in the PRD.md.
4. **Share Learnings**: Summarize what was learned and how it fixed the issue, feature, process, or understanding. This should be done in the knowledge base, PRD.md, and commit messages.

**Professional Note:**  
This process ensures that errors are surfaced, not hidden, and that the team benefits from collective learning. It aligns with a growth mindset and supports robust, maintainable, and auditable development practices.
