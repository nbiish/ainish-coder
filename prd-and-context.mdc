# Context = Knowledge Base = PRD

All code, features, and implementation decisions MUST strictly follow the Product Requirements Document (PRD.md)
and be based on factual information gathered into the project's KNOWLEDGE_BASE/*.

## KNOWLEDGE_BASE/*

- /docs*
- /requirements*
- /features*
- /issues*

## Technical & Methodology Choices

- All new features, bugfixes, and refactors must be cross-checked against the PRD.md and KNOWLEDGE_BASE/* for compliance.
- Any deviation or extension must be documented in the PRD.md and KNOWLEDGE_BASE/* before proceeding.
- All planning should happen in the PRD.md and reference specific content from the KNOWLEDGE_BASE/*.

### Example Usage When Adding a New Feature

When adding a new feature:

1. Concisely document the new feature in the PRD.md.
2. Gather the docs, facts, and context for the KNOWLEDGE_BASE/* to supply factual information to the PRD.md, README.md, and codebase.
3. Code must match factual information pulled from the KNOWLEDGE_BASE/*.
4. Update the PRD.md and KNOWLEDGE_BASE/* with the new feature details and usage.

### Example Usage When Fixing a Bug

When fixing a bug:

1. Update the PRD.md and KNOWLEDGE_BASE/* with the bug details and usage.
2. Gather the facts and context into the KNOWLEDGE_BASE/*.
3. Implement code changes to fix the bug.
4. Ensure all code aligns with the PRD.md and KNOWLEDGE_BASE/*.
