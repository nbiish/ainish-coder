1 breach/blast-radius: Can this be abused, and how far does damage spread before anyone notices?
2 privacy/data-lifecycle: What did we retain that we cannot defend, and can we actually erase it?
3 dependencies/provenance: What did we accept without proving where it came from?
4 structure/operations: Is this the right shape, and can it run at 3am by someone who did not write it?
5 failure/verification: What is the cheapest experiment that would falsify this claim?
6 authority/accountability: Who is allowed to decide this, and who answers for it?
7 automation/reproducibility: Can a machine run it unattended, and can anyone re-derive the result?
8 orchestration/self-correction: Is the work shaped right, and what would make me abandon this approach?
9 comprehension/operability: Can someone understand and safely change this without me?
