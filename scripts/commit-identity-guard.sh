# commit-identity-guard.sh — keep AI harnesses from becoming the author of the operator's history.
#
# Problem: several CLI/IDE agent harnesses set git identity, add attribution trailers, or rewrite
# config so their own name lands on commits. Some do it by prompt-injecting the agent, some by
# exporting GIT_AUTHOR_* themselves. The operator's profile must win either way.
#
# This runs as a post-commit hook. If the commit was authored by a harness, it rewrites the commit to
# `Nanoboozhoo - embodies by <harness>` and strips harness attribution lines from the message. If the
# commit is already the operator's, it does nothing. Idempotent, and it never touches a commit that
# does not name a harness.
#
# Escape hatch: AINISH_IDENTITY_GUARD=off disables it for one commit (also used internally to stop
# the amend from re-entering).
