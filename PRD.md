**Molecules:** 
- Triple deployment system
- Configuration distribution pipeline
- Shell integration system
- File format conversion system
- Cross-platform compatibility layer

**Matter:** 
- Core AINISH configuration system
- VSCode/Copilot integration system
- Markdown format deployment system
- Shell wrapper system

**Matter Phases:** 
- Installation phase (setup script execution)
- Configuration phase (file deployment)
- Integration phase (shell configuration)
- Usage phase (wrapper function execution)

**Lifeforms:** 
- Complete ainish-coder ecosystem
- Integrated AI development environment
- Cultural and technical hybrid system
